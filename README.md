# Image-Slider

November's Power BI update brings an exciting enhancement, allowing users to incorporate images into slicersâ€”an incredibly cool feature. The process is straightforward, requiring just a few simple steps. I've personally implemented this feature and encourage you to explore it as well. Feel free to share your feedback on this new capability!
